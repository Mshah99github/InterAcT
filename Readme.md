**Project Title :**
InterAcT: A Generic Keypoints-Based Lightweight Transformer Model for Recognition of Human Solo Actions and Interactions in Aerial Videos

**Project Description:** 
It is an activity recognition project which utilizes keypoints data, extracted from RGB videos using YOLO v8 pose estimation model. This project introduce a generic transformer model known as InterAcT, capable of recognizing solo human actions as well as human-human interactions in aerial videos.
